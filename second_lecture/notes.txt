when looking at returns we want at most 1 dividend timeframe. quaterly has 3 
dividends while monthly has 1

dividend is measured per share
everything is measured in a per share number

smallest is a nanosecond (smallest data period possible with financial data)

portfolio should either add up to 1 or 0 (can happen with shorting)
(called 0 cost portfolio)


portfolio is very general and can map into any trade strategy you can imagine.

finding mispricing is the economical holy grail
